* What is this?

	gcontact-yomigana is a simple (stupid) tool to automatically
	phoneticss to name components in Google Contacts.

	So far it only processes GivenName and FamilyName.


* What does this tool do?

	[IMPORTANT] If you don't want to get your Google Contacts injected
	against your will, make sure to create backup copy of them so that
	you can recover from unwanted changes.

	Run

		$ [mono] gcontact-yomigana.exe [username] [password] 

	to automatically fill phonetics.
	If there already are phonetics, then there will be no change.

	Run

		$ [mono] gcontact-yomigana.exe [username] [password] --delete

	to delete all phonetics fields from every contact.

	Due to some limitations, both process are very slow (it results in
	one web access for each update operation). Be patient.

	Yes, it is a stupid tool without any confirmation (so far).
	Any patches or forks are welcome.


* Build

	To build this tool, you have to install gdata-sharp-contacts
	package. Just run "make" to build it.

	Instead, you can copy Google.GData.Contacts.dll,
	Google.GData.Extensions.dll and Google.GData.Client.dll from
	google-gdata .NET project [*1] locally, and compile it with csc
	or gmcs. Local copies are needed only to build it. (You don't need
	them when you run it as long as they are in the GAC).

* Auto Phonetics Generation Internals

	It simply uses mecab[*2] with a simple stupid CGI script[*3]. Don't
	expect to be very precise, it's not dedicated for Japanese names.
